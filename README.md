# PostgreSQL Bad Movie Portal

A comprehensive admin portal for managing "bad movie viewing experiments" - community events where groups watch intentionally terrible movies together. This system serves as the authoritative database and management interface for the Big Screen Bad Movies community.

## 🎬 Project Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

**Current Status**: The portal is **production-ready** with complete movie and experiment management, robust data import/export capabilities, and a modern responsive interface.

### ✅ Major Accomplishments (Recently Completed)

**🗄️ Database Recovery & Import System**
- Successfully rebuilt PostgreSQL database from CSV and WordPress data after data loss
- Imported **979 unique movies**, **508 experiments**, and **1,013 movie-experiment relationships**
- Implemented intelligent deduplication by TMDb/IMDb ID
- Added robust 3D movie detection and flagging system
- Built comprehensive data validation and error handling

**🔧 Advanced Export/Backup System**
- Implemented full-featured export system with CSV and JSON formats
- Added preview functionality before export
- Support for selective exports (all data, movies only, experiments only, people only)
- Configurable relationship and metadata inclusion
- **Disaster recovery ready** - complete system backup and restore capability

**🎯 Enhanced User Experience**
- Modern, responsive React interface with dark theme
- Advanced search and filtering across all content types
- Real-time search with debounced input (no page refreshes)
- Comprehensive pagination with customizable page sizes
- Loading states and error handling throughout

**🔍 Search & Performance Improvements**
- Server-side filtering and pagination for optimal performance
- Full-text search across movie titles, descriptions, and experiment details
- Year-based filtering with dynamic year discovery
- Sortable columns with persistent state

**🚀 Experiments Page Performance Optimization (Latest Update)**
- **Massive performance improvement**: Reduced page load time from 10+ seconds to under 1 second
- Eliminated inefficient `calculateEncoreStatus` function that was loading entire database on every request
- Refactored frontend to match Movies page patterns for consistent UX
- Implemented proper separation of concerns with dedicated fetch functions
- Added debounced search with instant results
- Updated grid layout to 5 columns with wider 4:3 aspect ratio cards for better visual balance
- Maintained search functionality for movie titles within experiments
- Removed temporary encore calculations to prioritize performance

**🎬 TMDb Import UX Enhancement (Latest Update)**
- **Revolutionary workflow improvement**: Completely redesigned TMDb movie import process
- **New flow**: TMDb search → Select movie → Auto-populated form → Review & Save
- **Reliability boost**: Now uses proven TMDb sync mechanism instead of fragile direct import
- **Better UX**: Users can review and edit all fields before saving (no more failed imports)
- **Seamless integration**: Leverages existing, working form validation and save functionality
- **Intuitive design**: One-click selection opens pre-filled movie form with auto-import
- **Zero reinvention**: Smart reuse of existing, reliable components and workflows
